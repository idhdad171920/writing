            <p>Kai Solon pushed open the sliding balcony door and stepped out into the night, exhaling as the cold autumn air tightened around him. The chill hit fast, turning his breath into a pale cloud that drifted into the dark.</p>
            
            <p>It was already late—close to midnight—but the college campus had kept him longer than planned. Senior year always did. Group projects, labs, exams, and endless deadlines. Thursdays were supposed to feel like a break… except tomorrow was Friday.</p>
            
            <p>Which meant the weekend shift.</p>
            
            <p>Which meant a 5 a.m. opening at the coffee shop six blocks down.</p>
            
            <p>Kai groaned just thinking about it.</p>
            
            <p>He leaned onto the railing of the small balcony, hoodie pulled tight, warm takeout cup of coffee between his palms. The warmth seeped into his fingers, grounding him.</p>
            
            <p>Denver sprawled below, glowing soft orange against the black sky. Leaves skittered across the pavement in the wind, rattling like dry bones. The air smelled faintly of rain and mountain cold.</p>
            
            <p>Kai raised his gaze.</p>
            
            <p>The stars were stunning tonight. Sharp. Cold. Clear. Like diamonds scattered across velvet.</p>
            
            <p>He felt that old tug again—a heaviness behind his ribs, the quiet pull of the sky. He'd felt it since childhood, since lying on Hawaiian sand beside his grandparents and learning the stories they carried in their bones.</p>
            
            <p>"The Twelve guard the heavens," Grandma whispered once. "But the Thirteenth waits where the light cannot reach."</p>
            
            <p>Kai took a slow sip of coffee. He shouldn't be thinking about that.</p>
            
            <p>Not tonight.</p>
            
            <p>The apartment door slid open behind him.</p>
            
            <p>Eli stepped out in NASA sweatpants, an oversized hoodie, and a blanket wrapped around his shoulders like a cape. His breath puffed visibly as he tightened the blanket dramatically.</p>
            
            <p>"Bro." Eli shivered, voice vibrating. "It's freezing. Why are we like this? Why did we choose Colorado? Why didn't we apply somewhere warm? Like… the sun?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai smirked. "You love it here."</p>
            
            <p>"I love NASA," Eli corrected. "Not frostbite."</p>
            
            <p>Kai lifted his cup. "Coffee helps."</p>
            
            <p>"I tried that," Eli said, stepping closer. "It did nothing. My soul is cold."</p>
            
            <p>The blanket fluttered in the breeze like a sad cape.</p>
            
            <p>Kai snorted.</p>
            
            <p>They stood there in companionable silence, both staring at the starry sky.</p>
            
            <p>"You ready for tomorrow?" Kai asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Not mentally," Eli replied. "But physically? Also no."</p>
            
            <p>Kai huffed a small laugh.</p>
            
            <p>Weekend shifts were brutal. But the three of them—Kai, Eli, Mira—always ended up working them together. And somehow, that made it easier.</p>
            
            <p>Kai lifted his gaze again.</p>
            
            <p>The stars seemed… too bright tonight. Too crisp for the city. He tilted his head slightly, frowning.</p>
            
            <p>Eli noticed immediately. "Hey. Don't go all thoughtful. That's suspicious."</p>
            
            <p>Kai didn't get a chance to respond.</p>
            
            <p>Because the stars disappeared.</p>
            
            <p>All of them.</p>
            
            <p>Gone in a blink.</p>
            
            <p>Silence slammed into the balcony—heavy, suffocating, unnatural. The city lights still glowed, but above them, there was only smooth, perfect black. No clouds. No moon. No stars.</p>
            
            <p>A void.</p>
            
            <p>Eli's breath froze mid-sentence. "What—wait—what?!"</p>
            
            <p>Kai's mug slipped from his hand, hitting the concrete with a soft thud.</p>
            
            <p>The pressure hit him instantly—deep, crushing, like the air thickened into stone. His heartbeat stuttered, then thundered against his ribs.</p>
            
            <p>A sensation washed over him—terribly familiar.</p>
            
            <p>As if something enormous had opened an eye.</p>
            
            <p>As if something ancient was listening.</p>
            
            <p>Seven seconds. Seven long, impossible seconds.</p>
            
            <p>Kai felt his knees weaken.</p>
            
            <p>He heard his grandparents' voices whispering through memory:</p>
            
            <p>"When the sky goes silent, the old truths stir."</p>
            
            <p>Then—</p>
            
            <p>Snap.</p>
            
            <p>The stars flashed back on, flooding the darkness with sudden, dazzling light. Too sharp. Too bright. Like someone had scrubbed the universe clean.</p>
            
            <p>Eli gasped, staggering back. "WHOA—What the—Kai?! Did you—Did we—Did the SKY just turn OFF?!"</p>
            
            <p>Kai didn't answer.</p>
            
            <p>Because he saw it.</p>
            
            <p>Between two bright stars, a shape curled and uncurled— long thin serpentine.</p>
            
            <p>Kai blinked hard—</p>
            
            <p>It vanished.</p>
            
            <p>"Kai?" Eli asked again, breath still fogging. "Dude. Dude. Say something."</p>
            
            <p>Kai tore his gaze away from the sky. "We should get some sleep."</p>
            
            <p>"That's your reaction?" Eli sputtered. "The cosmos had a stroke, and you want BEDTIME?!"</p>
            
            <p>Kai brushed past him softly, stepping inside.</p>
            
            <p>But the truth pressed against him with every breath:</p>
            
            <p>The sky wasn't supposed to blink. The stars weren't supposed to move like that. And whatever Kai saw…</p>
            
            <p>Saw him back. And came for him in his dreams.</p>
            
            <p>Sleep didn't protect him—didn't even touch him. He tossed, turned, saw flashes of gold and coils of shadow each time he closed his eyes. By the time his alarm blared, he was already awake.</p>

            <p>Before the sun woke up, Kai and Eli stepped outside into the freezing predawn air, both bundled in their coffee shop uniforms layered with hoodies. Their breaths formed white clouds as they trudged down the apartment stairs, the cold biting instantly at their faces.</p>
            
            <p>Denver in the early morning felt like walking through a refrigerator—dark, crisp, and quiet except for the rumble of traffic waking up. Gold and red leaves scattered across the sidewalks like someone had spilled autumn confetti everywhere.</p>
            
            <p>Eli tightened his NASA beanie over his curls. "Dude, it is too early for the human experience."</p>
            
            <p>Kai shoved his hands deeper into his hoodie pockets. "You say that every shift."</p>
            
            <p>"And every shift I mean it."</p>
            
            <p>They reached the sidewalk, crunching through leaves as they walked. The wind cut around the corners of buildings, sending another wave of cold stabbing through them.</p>
            
            <p>Eli hugged himself. "Why did we choose a job that makes us wake up before the sun?!"</p>
            
            <p>Kai glanced at him. "Because we're broke."</p>
            
            <p>"Right," Eli said dramatically. "Punished by poverty. Cursed by capitalism. Student Loans."</p>
            
            <p>Kai snorted softly.</p>
            
            <p>Light from a streetlamp flickered. Kai's eyes instinctively lifted to the sky—just a quick check.</p>
            
            <p>The stars were still there. Normal. Bright. Calm.</p>
            
            <p>But even in their normalcy, something about them felt… sharp.</p>
            
            <p>Eli noticed. "You checking for Cosmic Reboot Round Two?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai shrugged. "Just… making sure."</p>
            
            <p>"Bro, that was insane," Eli said, shivering again. "I was brushing my teeth, scrolling through random Reddit threads and suddenly the universe forgot to pay its electric bill."</p>
            
            <p>Kai didn't answer immediately. He stared straight ahead, jaw tight.</p>
            
            <p>Eli nudged him. "Okay. Spill. Because you keep doing the thing."</p>
            
            <p>"What thing?"</p>
            
            <p>"The quiet internal panic spiral thing."</p>
            
            <p>Kai sighed. Eli wasn't wrong.</p>
            
            <p>"It felt… familiar," Kai admitted.</p>
            
            <p>Eli blinked. "Dude. Nothing about giant sky-blackouts should feel familiar."</p>
            
            <p>Kai kicked a leaf, watching it skitter across the pavement. He didn't want to say it, but keeping it in felt worse.</p>
            
            <p>"When I was little," he said quietly, "my family used to go camping on the beaches of Oahu where the water silently crashed into the sand. We'd stare at the stars every night."</p>
            
            <p>Eli smiled softly. "That sounds amazing."</p>
            
            <p>Kai hesitated. "My grandparents used to tell us stories… old stories passed down from their grandparents. About the sky."</p>
            
            <p>Eli perked up. "Myth time?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai nodded slowly.</p>
            
            <p>"They said the sky had guardians once. Twelve of them. And one more that was… lost. Or banished. Or something."</p>
            
            <p>Eli tilted his head. "The 13th? Like the snake constellation?"</p>
            
            <p>"Yeah," Kai murmured. The cold wind blew harder than before. Kai's breath puffed into the darkness.</p>
            
            <p>"They said the Thirteenth hid in the spaces where light couldn't reach," he continued. "And if the stars ever went silent…"</p>
            
            <p>"…he was listening?" Eli whispered, finishing the thought.</p>
            
            <p>Kai swallowed hard. "Yeah."</p>
            
            <p>They walked in silence for a moment. The crunch of leaves beneath their shoes was oddly loud.</p>
            
            <p>Eli bumped Kai's shoulder gently. "Man… look, myths are cool and all, but the universe is huge. Random stuff happens."</p>
            
            <p>Kai didn't respond.</p>
            
            <p>Eli studied him, concerned. "You can tell me if there's more."</p>
            
            <p>Kai hesitated, glancing away. "It's nothing."</p>
            
            <p>But he knew it wasn't nothing.</p>
            
            <p>He'd been having dreams since he was five—dreams of a serpent circling a dying sun, chains breaking, a voice murmuring to him in the dark.</p>
            
            <p>He never told anyone. Not his siblings. Not his parents. Not even his grandparents, who already believed too much.</p>
            
            <p>Eli sighed. "Fine. Don't tell me. But I can read your soul, and your soul is freaking out."</p>
            
            <p>Kai managed a weak laugh. "That's a weird thing to say."</p>
            
            <p>"Everything I say is weird. It's part of my charm."</p>
            
            <p>Kai couldn't deny it.</p>
            
            <p>They crossed through a small park, the ground covered in leaves. A gust of wind rattled the branches above them. The sky overhead was still clear, still bright with stars fading into early dawn—but Kai felt watched.</p>
            
            <p>Like the sky wasn't done with him yet.</p>
            
            <p>Ahead, their coffee shop glowed dimly at the corner of the street, warm lights spilling out onto the sidewalk.</p>
            
            <p>"You ready?" Eli asked, rubbing his hands together.</p>
            
            <p>Kai took a breath. "Yeah."</p>
            
            <p>"Liar," Eli said, pushing the door open.</p>
            
            <p>And maybe Kai was lying.</p>
            
            <p>Because the truth followed him like a shadow—quiet, cold, and ancient. Something wasn't right. And he could feel it in his bones.</p>

            <p>The door swung open, letting out a soft breath of warm air. The bell above the café jingled weakly as they stepped inside. The shop was still dim—half-lit by the warm glow of the pastry case and a single lamp someone had forgotten to turn off. The air smelled faintly of roasted beans and cinnamon.</p>
            
            <p>Mira Johnson stood behind the counter with her hair tied back into a high puff, her apron already on, and a half-empty cup of coffee in her hand. She was scanning the inventory clipboard with the intensity of someone preparing to interrogate it.</p>
            
            <p>"You're late," she said without looking up.</p>
            
            <p>Eli scoffed dramatically. "Wow. Good morning to you too, sunshine."</p>
            
            <p>"You're still late," Mira repeated, flipping a page.</p>
            
            <p>"It's literally 4:55," Eli said. "We don't open until five."</p>
            
            <p>"Which means you're late."</p>
            
            <p>Kai bit back a smile.</p>
            
            <p>Mira finally looked up—warm brown skin glowing under the warm shop lights, gold rings on her fingers catching the glimmer. Her eyes were sharp even at this hour, picking up every detail like she'd been born for it.</p>
            
            <p>A detective's eyes. Her father would've been proud.</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow at Kai. "You good? You look like you pulled an all-nighter."</p>
            
            <p>Kai slid behind the counter, tying his apron. "Just tired."</p>
            
            <p>"Mmhmm." Mira didn't look convinced. "Anything to do with the sky turning black?"</p>
            
            <p>Eli gasped. "You saw it too?! I thought maybe we hallucinated from lack of sleep."</p>
            
            <p>Mira shot him a flat look. "Do I look like the hallucinating type?"</p>
            
            <p>"Yes," Eli said instantly.</p>
            
            <p>She threw a napkin at him.</p>
            
            <p>Kai's laugh came out soft but genuine.</p>
            
            <p>Mira turned back to Kai. "Seriously. You look off. Like… more than usual."</p>
            
            <p>Kai shrugged. "Just startled me, that's all."</p>
            
            <p>Her eyes narrowed.</p>
            
            <p>Eli opened the pastry case and immediately dropped a tray of croissants.</p>
            
            <p>Mira didn't even flinch. "Eli."</p>
            
            <p>"I HAVE WEAK HANDS WHEN I'M COLD."</p>
            
            <p>"Or always?"</p>
            
            <p>"That's rude."</p>
            
            <p>Mira smirked and moved to wipe down the counter.</p>
            
            <p>Kai got to work prepping the espresso machine—his usual pre-opening routine. The familiar hiss and hum of warming metal steadied him. The small shop filled slowly with the scent of ground coffee as the grinder whirred.</p>
            
            <p>It felt normal. Comforting. Almost peaceful.</p>
            
            <p>But Mira kept watching him from the corner of her eye.</p>
            
            <p>"You're jumpy," she said casually, tossing a rag over her shoulder. "You keep checking the windows."</p>
            
            <p>Kai froze for half a second before forcing himself to move again.</p>
            
            <p>"Just tired," he repeated.</p>
            
            <p>"Liar," she said softly.</p>
            
            <p>Kai's hands paused on the portafilter.</p>
            
            <p>Mira didn't break eye contact.</p>
            
            <p>"My dad trained me to spot lies," she continued. "And you're basically neon-sign obvious right now."</p>
            
            <p>Eli chimed in from the fridge. "YEAH, KAI, YOU'RE NEON." He popped up holding a gallon of milk. "But like a tasteful neon. Not Vegas neon."</p>
            
            <p>Mira sighed. "Stop talking."</p>
            
            <p>Kai swallowed and focused on the espresso machine. "It's nothing. Really."</p>
            
            <p>Mira leaned on the counter. "If you say so."</p>
            
            <p>But she didn't buy it. And she didn't stop watching him.</p>
            
            <p>The moment hung in the air—tense, quiet, unfinished—until the front door opened and reality pushed its way back in. Customers trickled inside. Construction workers grabbing pre-shift coffees, college students in hoodies, a jogger who clearly regretted being awake at all.</p>
            
            <p>Mira snapped into motion, taking orders with practiced precision, while Eli bounced back into his usual oversized charisma, handing out drinks like he was auditioning for the role of "Chaotic Barista #1."</p>
            
            <p>But even in the noise and caffeine and morning chaos…</p>
            
            <p>Mira's eyes kept drifting back to Kai.</p>
            
            <p>And Kai felt it. Like pressure. Like expectation. Like something waiting for him to finally say out loud what he already knew.</p>
            
            <p>Kai moved between tasks throughout the morning—grinding beans, frothing milk, checking timers—trying to lose himself in routine. But he could feel Mira watching him again and again.</p>
            
            <p>Not suspicious. Concerned. Alert in a way normal people weren't.</p>
            
            <p>She approached silently when there was a lull.</p>
            
            <p>"Hey," she said quietly. "Tell me the truth. Did something else happen last night?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai's chest tightened.</p>
            
            <p>Eli leaned over the counter like a vulture listening for gossip. "YES. PLEASE TELL US."</p>
            
            <p>Mira pushed his face away. "Not you."</p>
            
            <p>Kai stared at the milk steamer. "I don't know how to explain it."</p>
            
            <p>"Try," Mira urged.</p>
            
            <p>Kai looked at the window—the mountains barely visible in the early dawn light, the sky still too bright for morning.</p>
            
            <p>"Something felt… wrong," he murmured. "When the stars went out."</p>
            
            <p>Mira leaned in, voice dropping. "Wrong how?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai's hand shook slightly.</p>
            
            <p>Mira noticed.</p>
            
            <p>Before he could answer, Eli blurted, "IF THIS IS ABOUT ALIENS I AM PREPARED BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY."</p>
            
            <p>Mira shoved him aside. "Go clean something."</p>
            
            <p>Eli wandered off muttering, "I AM CLEANING MY MIND."</p>
            
            <p>Kai almost smiled.</p>
            
            <p>Almost.</p>
            
            <p>Mira took advantage of the moment.</p>
            
            <p>"Talk to me," she said. "I want to know what's going on."</p>
            
            <p>Kai hesitated.</p>
            
            <p>The truth sat on his tongue, heavy and terrifying.</p>
            
            <p>But how could he tell her—or Eli—that he'd been dreaming about the stars cracking open since childhood? That he felt watched? That he saw something move in the sky last night?</p>
            
            <p>He wasn't ready.</p>
            
            <p>And Mira saw his answer in his silence.</p>
            
            <p>She stepped back, expression tightening—not angry, just thoughtful. Calculating.</p>
            
            <p>Watching him like a detective.</p>
            
            <p>The bell over the door jingled as more customers entered.</p>
            
            <p>Mira sighed quietly. "We'll talk later."</p>
            
            <p>Kai nodded.</p>
            
            <p>But the truth followed him through every movement, every breath, every heartbeat. The sky wasn't done with him. And Mira could sense something was coming long before he could admit it.</p>

            <p>The morning rush eventually drowned the moment—orders flying, machines hissing, customers complaining about nothing and everything. And slowly, bit by bit, the chaos thinned.</p>
            
            <p>Voices faded. Shadows lengthened. And the weight in Kai's chest never left.</p>
            
            <p>By the time the café finally settled into its usual mid-day lull, only a few stragglers remained. Warm sunlight drifted in through the windows, pooling across the wooden floor. Outside, gusts of wind sent piles of autumn leaves skittering down the sidewalk.</p>
            
            <p>Inside, the silence felt too still. Too expectant. Like the world was catching its breath… waiting for what came next.</p>
            
            <p>A couple of students studied in the corner. The air smelled like cinnamon and roasted beans.</p>
            
            <p>Kai wiped down tables, moving slower than usual through the afternoon. His hands trembled just enough that he kept them close to his sides. The blackout sky from last night replayed over and over in his mind like a stuck record.</p>
            
            <p>Eli watched him from the counter, leaning over it like a vulture waiting for a confession.</p>
            
            <p>"Kai," Eli finally said, voice gentle but insistent. "Dude. You've been doing the quiet freak-out all morning. That's… un-Kai-like. Like… goldfish seeing a book un-Kai-like."</p>
            
            <p>Kai raised an eyebrow. "That doesn't make sense."</p>
            
            <p>"Exactly!" Eli said, pointing. "That's how off you are. You are vibrating, man. VIBRATING. People don't vibrate unless they are either possessed or trying not to cry. Sometimes both."</p>
            
            <p>Mira set down a stack of syrup bottles and approached with her arms crossed, expression sharp. "He's not possessed."</p>
            
            <p>Eli gestured at Kai dramatically. "You don't know that."</p>
            
            <p>Mira didn't break eye contact with Kai. "But you are hiding something."</p>
            
            <p>Kai shifted uncomfortably. "Mira—"</p>
            
            <p>"No," she said softly but firmly. "I've known you since freshman 101. This isn't you. You're pale. Your hands won't stay still. You keep checking the windows every ten seconds. What aren't you telling us?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai opened his mouth to deflect— but the serious note in Mira's voice stopped him.</p>
            
            <p>She wasn't guessing. She was reading him.</p>
            
            <p>Kai leaned on the counter, staring at the wood grain. "When I was a kid… my grandparents used to tell me old stories about the sky."</p>
            
            <p>Eli immediately perked up. "Yes you said that this morning—old old stories. Like ancient Egyptian mummy curses."</p>
            
            <p>Kai blinked. "Older."</p>
            
            <p>Eli froze. "…there's older than Egyptian?"</p>
            
            <p>Mira stared. "Let him talk, Eli."</p>
            
            <p>Kai swallowed, remembering and exhaled slowly. "They weren't myths, exactly. More like… warnings disguised as bedtime stories. They told me the constellations weren't just shapes. They were graves. The remains of ancient beings who shaped the universe."</p>
            
            <p>Eli's eyes widened. "That's… actually pretty sick."</p>
            
            <p>Kai didn't smile.</p>
            
            <p>"They said there were twelve guardians who kept the balance of light. And then…" He hesitated. His throat tightened.</p>
            
            <p>Mira's voice softened. "Take your time."</p>
            
            <p>"…and then there was a thirteenth," Kai whispered. "A serpent. A shadow."</p>
            
            <p>Eli blinked. "Wait, wait, wait I know this—the snake constellation. Uh—Oph—Ophelia—"</p>
            
            <p>"Ophiuchus," Mira corrected without missing a beat.</p>
            
            <p>"Yes! Gesundheit," Eli said proudly.</p>
            
            <p>Mira sighed.</p>
            
            <p>"I've been having dreams," Kai finally said.</p>
            
            <p>Eli leaned in like he was about to hear classified NASA intel. "Dreams? Like… cosmic dreams? Or normal dreams? Or like the kind where I wake up and suddenly my pillow is gone—"</p>
            
            <p>"Elias Rivera," Mira snapped. "Shut up."</p>
            
            <p>"Shutting."</p>
            
            <p>"I've been dreaming about him since I was five," he admitted quietly. "The serpent. The darkness. The… voice."</p>
            
            <p>That stunned both of them.</p>
            
            <p>Eli's excitement melted into genuine fear. "Since five?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai nodded. "Yeah."</p>
            
            <p>Mira's tone softened. "Kai… dreams or not, this clearly isn't nothing. Why didn't you tell us?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai shook his head. "You'll think I'm crazy."</p>
            
            <p>Eli raised a hand. "Bro. Listen. I am your roommate. I know the weird noises you make while sleeping. We passed crazy like three semesters ago."</p>
            
            <p>Mira ignored the joke. "Kai. Whatever it is… we can handle it."</p>
            
            <p>Kai rubbed the back of his neck, eyes drifting toward the window. "Most dreams fade when you wake up. Mine never did. And last night… when the stars went out… it felt like the dream stepped into the world."</p>
            
            <p>Eli swallowed loudly. "I… do not like that wording."</p>
            
            <p>Mira leaned in slightly. "What exactly did you feel?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai hesitated. "I felt watched."</p>
            
            <p>Eli nearly dropped the tray he was holding. "Nope. Nope. I hate that. Why would you say that? Why would your brain say that to MY brain?!"</p>
            
            <p>Mira ignored him. Her eyes stayed locked on Kai. "Did you feel it before the blackout… or because of it?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai whispered, "Before."</p>
            
            <p>That made Mira stiffen.</p>
            
            <p>Before she could ask more, the overhead lights flickered—just once, but enough to make all three of them freeze.</p>
            
            <p>The temperature dipped. The air tightened. A faint hum vibrated against the walls.</p>
            
            <p>Eli's voice rose an octave. "Guys… guys… why do I feel like a ghost just licked my neck?"</p>
            
            <p>Mira stepped closer to Kai, eyes narrowing. "Kai. Look at me."</p>
            
            <p>Kai did.</p>
            
            <p>She saw it instantly— the way his pupils widened, the way his breath hitched, the way his spine went rigid.</p>
            
            <p>She whispered, "You feel it again, don't you?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai swallowed hard and exhaled shakily. "It's happening again."</p>
            
            <p>Eli froze. "Wh—okay, WHAT?! Dude, you can't drop horror movie lines with no follow-up—"</p>
            
            <p>Kai looked toward the windows, fear creeping into his voice.</p>
            
            <p>"…the sky," he whispered.</p>
            
            <p>A gust of wind slammed against the windows—so hard the glass trembled.</p>
            
            <p>Customers turned, startled murmurs rising.</p>
            
            <p>Mira stepped closer to Kai. "Are you okay?"</p>
            
            <p>Kai's hand gripped the counter as something hot flickered beneath his skin. A warning. A pressure. A pulse.</p>
            
            <p>Outside, someone screamed.</p>
            
            <p>Then another.</p>
            
            <p>Eli whispered, "Guys… whatever is happening is happening right now."</p>

            <p>The café stilled.</p>
            
            <p>Every voice died mid-sentence.</p>
            
            <p>Every head turned toward the windows as the afternoon sun dimmed—slowly at first, like heavy clouds dragging across the sky.</p>
            
            <p>But there were no clouds.</p>
            
            <p>Only… darkness. Thick. Rolling. Wrong.</p>
            
            <p>The light outside faded as though someone was lowering a cosmic dimmer switch. Shadows crawled across the floor. The temperature plunged; Kai's breath puffed white as if it were mid-winter instead of October.</p>
            
            <p>Phones lifted all at once. Dozens. Dozens more outside.</p>
            
            <p>People spilled into the street, pointing upward.</p>
            
            <p>The news station on the café TV cut in abruptly with an alert tone:</p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">BREAKING NEWS: SKY ANOMALY RETURNING LIVE COVERAGE</p>
            
            <p>The customers turned the volume up with shaking fingers.</p>
            
            <p>"…viewers are reporting the sun dimming across several U.S. cities—this appears to be a second global event—"</p>
            
            <p>Mira grabbed Kai's wrist. "Kai. Look at me."</p>
            
            <p>But he couldn't look away from the sky.</p>
            
            <p>The sun flickered— once then twice— and then went out.</p>
            
            <p>Pitch blackness swallowed the world. Instant. Absolute.</p>
            
            <p>Screams ripped through the street outside. Cars screeched and collided. People ran. People fell. People shouted into their phones—desperate for signals that weren't coming.</p>
            
            <p>Inside the café, customers huddled together, trembling.</p>
            
            <p>Eli whispered, voice barely audible, "Oh god… this is… this is worse."</p>
            
            <p>The TV crackled, the anchor stumbling over his words:</p>
            
            <p>"This is… unprecedented—scientists worldwide are attempting to understand the cause—we're seeing… total solar absence—"</p>
            
            <p>But Kai wasn't listening.</p>
            
            <p>The pressure inside his chest ready to detonate.</p>
            
            <p>Heat. Light. A pulse like a star being born.</p>
            
            <p>His knees buckled.</p>
            
            <p>Mira caught him under the arms. "Kai!!"</p>
            
            <p>Eli leapt over the counter, frantic. "Dude, DUDE—your arm!"</p>
            
            <p>A golden glow pulsed beneath Kai's sleeve, growing brighter—hotter—until the fabric began to smolder.</p>
            
            <p>And then—the sky above cracked open.</p>
            
            <p>A thin, glowing fracture tore across the heavens like lightning frozen in place.</p>
            
            <p>People filmed. People screamed. People dropped their phones.</p>
            
            <p>The world held its breath.</p>
            
            <p>Until something enormous moved behind the crack.</p>
            
            <p>A shadow. A coil. A shape too big to understand. Serpentine. Ancient.</p>
            
            <p>Eli's voice broke. "NOPE. Absolutely not. That is—THAT IS A BIG SNAKE. THAT IS A—WHAT IS THAT?!"</p>
            
            <p>Mira's grip tightened around Kai. "Kai! Are you okay?!"</p>
            
            <p>The heat within him finally erupted.</p>
            
            <p>A blinding explosion of golden light burst out of him, shaking the café to its foundation.</p>
            
            <p>Mira, Eli and others thrown across the room. People collapsed. Tables overturned. Glass shattered.</p>
            
            <p>And a lion-shaped silhouette roared across the walls— celestial radiant alive.</p>
            
            <p>Kai screamed— the world swallowed the sound— and everything went white.</p>
            
            <p>The blast of golden light vanished as fast as it came.</p>
            
            <p>One moment, the café was drenched in a blinding radiance— a giant lion-shaped silhouette roaring across the walls, every surface glowing like it had swallowed a star.</p>
            
            <p>Then—the light collapsed inward, sucked away like a wave retreating from the shore.</p>
            
            <p>And outside the windows—</p>
            
            <p>The darkness retreated. Like ink pulled back by unseen hands.</p>
            
            <p>The black sky brightened. The fissure sealed. Sunlight returned in a sudden, jarring wash— warm, bright, normal.</p>
            
            <p>The world outside gasped with relief.</p>
            
            <p>Phones lit back up. Car alarms stopped. People stumbled into the street blinking, confused. The wind returned. The cold lifted.</p>
            
            <p>It was as if the universe had a panic attack… and now pretended it hadn't.</p>
            
            <p>But inside the café?</p>
            
            <p>Nothing felt normal.</p>
            
            <p>Tables were overturned. Glass glittered across the floor. Drinks spilled in pools under the counter.</p>
            
            <p>And Kai lay collapsed at the center of it all.</p>
            
            <p>His body was limp. Chest rising in weak, unsteady breaths. Golden light flickered faintly beneath the skin of his forearm—the last fading heartbeat of something ancient.</p>
            
            <p>Mira got up and ran over. Hitting the floor first.</p>
            
            <p>"Kai! Kai, look at me!" She grabbed his shoulders, voice trembling. "Kai—please—wake up—"</p>
            
            <p>His eyelids fluttered, then closed again.</p>
            
            <p>Eli, slightly dazed, got up and vaulted over the counter, nearly tripping, landing in a heap beside them. "Oh god—Kai? Dude?! DUDE?!"</p>
            
            <p>He reached for Kai, then yanked his hand back when the heat scorched his palm. "Ow—! His arm is like—like a toaster! Like a holy toaster!"</p>
            
            <p>Mira pressed two fingers to Kai's neck. Pulse—weak, but there. She exhaled shakily.</p>
            
            <p>"He's alive," she whispered. "I've got him."</p>
            
            <p>Around them, customers panicked:</p>
            
            <p>"What just happened?!" "The sun went OUT—" "Did he explode?!" "Don't get close—he was glowing—" "Someone call 911!"</p>
            
            <p>Mira snapped her head up. "EVERYONE BACK UP!"</p>
            
            <p>Her tone—sharp, commanding, trained—cut through the chaos. People stumbled away, rattled.</p>
            
            <p>Eli pulled out his phone, still shaking. "I'm calling—calling—okay—"</p>
            
            <p>But his screen flashed:</p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">NO SIGNAL.</p>
            
            <p>He stared. "What? What?! No—come on—Cosmic blackout is OVER. WHY don't I have service?!"</p>
            
            <p>"Try the shop phone," Mira said.</p>
            
            <p>Eli scrambled to the landline.</p>
            
            <p>It worked.</p>
            
            <p>He dialed 911 with trembling fingers. "Hi—yeah—uh—we need an ambulance—like NOW—our friend exploded—well—not exploded exploded—but—just—SEND ANYONE—"</p>
            
            <p>Mira ignored the commentary and leaned closer to Kai.</p>
            
            <p>"Kai," she murmured. "you're going to be okay." Her thumb brushed his cheek. "Hang in there."</p>
            
            <p>Kai inhaled sharply. His lips parted.</p>
            
            <p>Two faint words leaked out:</p>
            
            <p>"…the chains…"</p>
            
            <p>Mira froze. Eli stopped rambling mid-sentence.</p>
            
            <p>"What chains?" Mira asked urgently. "Kai—Kai, what chains?"</p>
            
            <p>But he was already slipping away, consciousness fading like a dying ember.</p>
            
            <p>Red and blue lights flickered outside as emergency vehicles pulled up. Sirens echoed down the street, bouncing off buildings.</p>
            
            <p>Mira grabbed Eli's arm, steadying herself. "We're going with him."</p>
            
            <p>Eli nodded instantly. "Obviously. Just need to confirm he can still cough up his half of the rent this month before my wallet starts crying. I'm not leaving."</p>
            
            <p>But as they lifted Kai's limp body, something became clear:</p>
            
            <p>The sky had gone back to normal— but they had not.</p>
            
            <p>The customers whispered, terrified. A few stared at Kai like he was radioactive. One man crossed himself.</p>
            
            <p>The lion sigil on Kai's arm glowed faintly— a soft, steady pulse imprinted on Kai's skin like a bad sun burn.</p>
            
            <p>Mira's voice dropped to a whisper, meant only for Eli:</p>
            
            <p>"He's not done."</p>
            
            <p>Eli swallowed. "Who's not done?"</p>
            
            <p>Mira didn't look away from the sigil.</p>
            
            <p>"The sky."</p>

            <p>As paramedics lifted Kai onto the stretcher, the lion sigil dimmed beneath the blanket—still glowing faintly like a heartbeat caught between worlds.</p>
            
            <p>Outside, the sun shone again. Cars moved again. People spoke again.</p>
            
            <p>But the fear lingered.</p>
            
            <p>Phones captured every angle. News vans rolled up the street. Reporters shouted questions no one could answer.</p>
            
            <p>Mira and Eli followed close behind the stretcher, their shadows long in the afternoon light.</p>
            
            <p>Denver was breathing again.</p>
            
            <p>But far from the café— far from the sirens and questions and stunned confusion— someone else was watching.</p>
            
            <p>Someone who had expected the lion's return.</p>
            
            <p>Someone who had been waiting.</p>
            
            <p>The camera flash from the crowd was the last thing Kai saw before darkness swallowed him whole.</p>
            
            <p>And in that darkness…</p>
            
            <p>another place stirred.</p>
            
            <p>High in the mountains, where the wind carved its own language across the jagged stone, an abandoned mining tunnel hid a truth older than the nation built around it. Past rusted beams and collapsed shafts, a heavy iron door stood sealed against the world. It slid open with a low hiss—revealing a cavern that should not have existed.</p>

            <p>A cathedral of black stone stretched out beneath the mountain. Torches burned along the walls, flames the color of sickly green moss. Shadows clung to everything, thick and alive, as if they watched from the corners.</p>

            <p>Only the highest ranks of the Serpent’s Tail were permitted here.</p>

            <p>An organization as old as the first human civilzation. Hunting and killing in silence throughout the ages in search of the Bearer's.</p>

            <p>Tonight, they gathered.</p>

            <p>A single Scale stood at the outer ring of the chamber, head bowed. His mask—layered like serpent scales—gleamed in the torchlight as he held a tablet streaming the footage from Denver to a giant screen bolted into the stone wall.</p>

            <p>Closer to the center, three Vessels chanted in low, rhythmic breaths. Their carved, rune-marked masks gave them the appearance of ancient priests, figures torn from another time.</p>

            <p>But it was the Shrouds who commanded the room—six figures posted in a perfect circle around the central stone altar. Their masks were pure void-black, smooth and featureless. No eye slits. No mouth. No humanity. Only a serpent mark on their foreheads</p>

            <p>And at the heart of them all, a seventh figure stood still as stone.</p>

            <p>The Voice of the Thirteenth.<br>
            The Head of the Serpent.<br>
            The unseen, unaging leader who never removed the mask or heavy hooded robe. A true shadow from head to toe</p>

            <p>The leader's presence did not simply command the chamber—it suffocated it.</p>

            <p>The Scale knelt, body trembling. “We have confirmation. The event lasted thirteen seconds during the global blackout. Solamar's light shined across the city. The signal originated from Denver’s center.”</p>

            <p>A Vessel stepped forward. “The constellation shined bright in the sky at that same moment. Exactly as the ancient texts predicted when a bearer awakens.”</p>

            <p>The Shrouds bowed low, their movements eerily synchronized.</p>

            <p>One Vessel continued, voice wavering with reverence, “One more sigil have fallen today. With this awakening, the pattern accelerates. If four more fall, the Chain—”</p>

            <p>“—will break,” the leader finished.</p>

            <p>Their voice filtered through layered distortion, bending unnaturally.<br>
            No one could tell if it was human or divine.</p>

            <p>The Vessels lowered their heads.</p>

            <p>The Scale swallowed. “Based on the footage, we know the Bearer is young. American. Male. Possibly unaware of his nature.”</p>

            <p>A Shroud stepped forward. “Should we dispatch the Fangs? Or should we send in the Coils like we did with Marava's Bearer today, my lord?”</p>

            <p>The leader tilted their mask slightly—an almost human gesture, yet somehow not.</p>

            <p>“Send both. Fangs are to observe,” the Voice commanded.<br>
            “have the Coils engage Leo's Bearer.”</p>

            <p>The torches flickered violently, bending toward him, as if drawn by his words.</p>

            <p>“A new Bearer awakening is not a threat—<br>
            yet.<br>
            But his light will grow.<br>
            And when it does,<br>
            he will harness the true power of Solamar.”</p>

            <p>The cavern trembled. Even the mountain seemed to recoil.</p>

            <p>A Vessel whispered, voice thick with awe: “The Thirteenth stirs. He feels the loosening of the Chain.”</p>

            <p>“Good.” The Voice’s tone deepened, layered with something old.<br>
            “A dormant god is blind.<br>
            A waking god sees.”</p>

            <p>He lifted a gloved hand.<br>
            Instant silence fell.</p>

            <p>“Find the Bearer.<br>
            before courage takes root—<br>
            let the void consume his light.”</p>

            <p>The Shrouds dropped to their knees as one.</p>

            <p>The Vessels followed.</p>

            <p>The Scale pressed his forehead to the cold stone floor.</p>

            <p>“The shadow rises,” they chanted.</p>

            <p>“The serpent wakes.”</p>

            <p>“Thirteen will walk again.”</p>

            <p>The Voice stepped backward into deeper shadow.<br>
            His outline dissolved into the darkness—<br>
            as if the darkness was swallowing him whole.</p>

            <p>Only his final whisper lingered, carried on the torchlight’s dying breath:</p>

            <p>“Do not fail me.”</p>

            <p>Then all torches extinguished at once.</p>

            <p>The chamber fell into absolute black.</p>

            <p>Something ancient moved in that darkness—<br>
            and the mountain felt smaller for it.</p>
