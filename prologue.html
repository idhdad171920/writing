            <p>Before time crawled, before darkness learned to swallow, the universe lay in perfect stillness. No flicker. No breath. No memory. Only the eternal void—cold, complete, immutable. Then the void trembled. A single vibration rippled through that endless silence. Instead of fading, it grew. It stretched the dark thin until it tore, and from that rupture erupted the first star.</p>
            
            <p>The star screamed as it was born.</p>
            
            <p>Its light burst outward, ripping through the void with a cry bright enough to wound creation itself. From the echo of that scream, thirteen silhouettes formed, sculpted from fire, gravity, and the raw bones of existence. Their eyes opened like newborn suns. Twelve rose in harmony, and one rose in silence.</p>
            
            <p>Azerion emerged first, a titan of molten fire whose steps sparked new stars. Torvall followed, a living mountain carved from planetary stone. Lumira and Lureon split from a single beam of light, twin minds mirrored perfectly. Marava flowed into being like a tide shaped into flesh. Solamar blazed golden, Seraphe shimmered as a blade of truth, Veridion moved in the precision of cosmic law. Kytheris unfurled venom-dark wings, Arclion streaked across the heavens like a comet, Thaleus arrived wrapped in centuries, Aquilaen thundered as shifting storms, and Neressa whispered herself into being, half-dream, half-shadow.</p>
            
            <p>Then came Enkizahur—the Deep Secret—quiet and observant, born not from the blaze of creation but from the hidden truths buried in the first star's dying cry. His purpose was to know creation so the others could shape it without fear. But knowledge is not gentle. It consumes more than it reveals.</p>
            
            <p>The Celestials walked the blank cosmos, leaving creation in their wake. Galaxies ignited beneath Azerion's roar. Torvall sculpted drifting stone into worlds. Marava filled barren spheres with oceans. Arclion shot arrows that became constellations. Neressa whispered dreams into dust. And through all of it, Enkizahur learned. His hunger deepened—quiet, endless.</p>
            
            <p>At the edge of the expanding universe, he found a seam in reality, a tear older than the first star—a breath of darkness the cosmos recoiled from. The Twelve sensed danger. "Some truths are not meant for existence," Seraphe warned.</p>
            
            <p>"Some doors remain sealed," Veridion murmured. But Enkizahur reached into the dark, and the dark welcomed him.</p>
            
            <p>A serpent of ancient knowledge slithered into his celestial essence. His body cracked like dying starlight. A monstrous shadow—serpent-shaped—rose behind him, devouring the glow around him. When he turned back, his eyes contained revelation.</p>
            
            <p>He summoned the Twelve and showed them what he had seen.</p>
            
            <p>They watched the First Secret: all light dies. Stars burn out. Worlds collapse. Even gods fade. The universe is a doomed flare destined to freeze. They watched the Second Secret: where life blooms, suffering follows. Worlds birthing war. Civilizations birthing greed. Joy birthing mourning. Hope birthing grief. And then the Third Secret: only nothingness is mercy. To return all things to silence would end suffering forever.</p>
            
            <p>The visions shattered them. Marava's tears froze into drifting shards. Solamar's mane dimmed. Kytheris's wings shook. Even Veridion's scales faltered. None had ever known fear. Not until this.</p>
            
            <p>Enkizahur did not seek destruction—he sought release. An end to pain itself.</p>
            
            <p>He began the Devouring.</p>
            
            <p>A young sun died beneath his touch. A constellation vanished. A galaxy froze as he breathed upon it. Light dimmed. Worlds trembled. And in the deepening dark, Kytheris whispered, "He is consuming the heavens…" her voice trembling.</p>
            
            <p>The Twelve chased him across collapsing star fields, dying nebulae, worlds stripped bare. Ages passed in the pursuit. Civilizations rose and crumbled beneath their shadows. Every strike they made only fed the serpent within him. He was not fleeing; he was heading toward the one place they could not allow—the center of creation, the birthplace of the first star. If he consumed that spark, the universe would collapse inward like a dying lung. Everything would end. The Twelve understood: they had to stop him here, even if it cost them everything.</p>
            
            <p>With every battle through the eons, they realized they could not kill or stop him. As a final effort to end the madness, the Twelve called upon the oldest laws woven into the cosmos—they tore fragments of themselves free. Flame, stone, dream, truth, life, time, law, courage, storm, shadow, tide, thought—all fused into a single blinding chain. The Celestial Chain pulsed with their dying force as they bound Enkizahur at the place where all had begun.</p>
            
            <p>Reality cracked. The first star screamed again. The Chain tightened, blinding him, crippling his hunger. And Enkizahur was dragged into the deep beyond—outside creation, outside memory, outside name—sealed into the endless abyss.</p>
            
            <p>The Twelve collapsed. Their bodies flickered, their light crumbling into dust. Their consciousness thinned like fading echoes. Yet before the final spark left them, they saw one last truth: if the Thirteenth ever escaped, no god would remain to stop him.</p>
            
            <p>With dying sight, they searched the cosmos for a species capable of carrying their legacy. They searched across the cosmos and found worlds of living flame, worlds carved from crystal, worlds older than galaxies, worlds advanced beyond imagination, worlds primitive as dust. Worlds violent, peaceful, brilliant, monstrous. Worlds that could break mountains and worlds too delicate to survive a storm.</p>
            
            <p>None could bear their essence. Until they found one. A young quiet world. Small. Blue. Soft. Unremarkable. Hidden in the corner of space, away from the chaos, this was the perfect gem.</p>
            
            <p>Its creatures are fragile, but burning with possibility. They dreamed like gods, chose their fate freely, grew stronger through suffering, carried a faint spark of the First Star within their souls, and—most importantly—remained invisible to Enkizahur.</p>
            
            <p>They were the perfect failsafe.</p>
            
            <p>With their final breaths of divinity, the Twelve divided their essence into twelve symbols, anchoring them into mortal bloodlines. The First Bearers. Their power slept. Their names faded into myth. The gods died.</p>
            
            <p>Their bodies dissolved into stardust, drifting into the heavens. Their remnants formed luminous shapes across the night sky—patterns mortals would one day name the Zodiac, unaware they gazed upon the graves of gods.</p>
            
            <p>Ages passed. Civilizations rose and shattered. War and greed echoed across the cosmos. And somewhere in the abyss beyond the stars, Enkizahur heard the cries. Not fully awake—but stirring. Dreaming of light. Dreaming of the Chain. Dreaming of hunger.</p>
            
            <p>He whispered back, to wanderers, prophets, dreamers, scholars, madmen, to anyone desperate enough to listen. He taught them to pry at the hidden chains. To weaken the symbols. To break the lineage of the Bearers. And through those whispered secrets spread the prophecy carved into the Celestial Chain:</p>
            
            <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 2em;">"When starlight falters and seven sigils dim,<br>
            the Circle shall shatter and the Chains grow thin.<br>
            Where twelve once burned, only fragments will lie,<br>
            and the Thirteenth, long-bound, shall open his eye.<br>
            Blinded by radiance, shackled by light,<br>
            The Serpent sleeps silently in perpetual night.<br>
            But weaken the brilliance that holds him in place,<br>
            and he shall awaken to reclaim the dark space.<br>
            For when half of the heavens in silence do fall,<br>
            the Chains shall unravel… and he shall end all."</p>
            
            <p>The stars trembled. The seal thinned. And somewhere in the quiet dark, a mortal began to dream of a serpent coiled around a dying sun. Something ancient was waking. Something hungry. Something is coming.</p>
